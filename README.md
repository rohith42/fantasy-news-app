# Fantasy News App

This web app is for users to sign in, add your favorite NFL teams and players, and easily see reliable top headlines for the selected player or team.
Users can sign in using Google, and their roster is saved on Firestore. Top headlines are fetched from newsapi.org.
This is built with React, Context for app-wide state management, Bootstrap for styling, Firebase for Google Authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Axios for get requests.

As of 09/16/2022, this is more of a general news app since you are not limited to adding only NFL teams and players to your roster, but I am wokring to get that feature-set functional.
Other than that, there are some style and UX improvments that I am currently working on.

Two files that are not in this repo are the firebase-config.js and api-keys.js files since they contain sensitive information.
